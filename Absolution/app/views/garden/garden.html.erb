				<h2 id="small-title">First Encounter</h2>
				<%= image_tag "garden/first_encounter_door.jpg" %></br>

					<h2 id="small-title">Overview and Setup</h2>
						<p id="details">For the first encounter load out is relative to what you feel comfortable with, I personally like to use a high damage super, a high impact sniper, good add clear weapon for the energy slot and either an LMG or grenade launcher in the heavy slot. If your looking to mix up your load out a sword is also works for killing the champions. For this encounter the teams will be split into two teams of three. You initially will have a stay team who will hang back and babysit the boss, and a go team who will move forward through the first door and clear adds in the following room. These teams will leapfrog each other as the encounter progresses, with each jump having the teams swap roles. </p>

					<h2 id="small-title">Stay Team</h2>
						<p id="details">The first team to stay behind, will be responsible for picking up the bosses wipe mechanic in the form of a large square mote the boss spits out. When picking up this mote, you will be given a 2 minute debuff called voltaic overflow. This debuff will cause you to die if you pick up another mote while its active. Be aware that the mote pickups are proximity based, so standing too close to a player picking up will also give you the debuff, if you already have it this will cause a death. Pickups can be called before hand, and should be staggered between the three players. Once a player has picked up they should be concentrating on add clear, after the first pickup two cyclopes will spawn in the arena with the boss and should be dealt with as quickly as possible. Once the away team has opened the door in the forward area, the stay team will progress past the away team and their roles will be swapped.</p>

					<h2 id="small-title">Away Team</h2>
						<p id="details">The away team will initially be the ones opening the door at the start of the encoutner, and then will progress forward into the next room killing adds as they move. There will be one overload minotaur and one cyclops, as well as a handful of red bar goblins and two hobgoblins. Once these adds have been killed, a yellow bar hydra will spawn called an "angelic" and when this final add is killed it will remove the shield over the tether box allowing the team to form a chain form the box to the tether point on the forward door. Once this door opens, the boss will dive into the ground from the previous room into the room that was just cleared, be careful of the boss entering the room as it will kill anyone standing in its spawn area. The away team will become responsible for picking up the bosses mote and preventing the wipe while the original stay team will progress forward and clear the room. This will allow the teams to stagger their pickups and prevent the need for players to sacrifice a life in order to pick up the mote.</p>

					<h2 id="small-title">Final Run</h2>
						<p id="details">After the last door is opened, the two teams will merge together for a final run down a long runway with multiple cyclopes on either side and three overload minotaurs at each pickup location. At this point its imperative to pick up the bosses mote, even if it means a player sacrificing themselves. As long as the revive timer hasn't been expended in previous rooms, you can afford to sacrifice a player to each of the three spits as the boss teleports down the runway. The overload minotaurs can be left alive if needed, but the cyclopes need to be killed as quickly as possible to prevent multiple players dying while picking up the bosses mote spit. Once the three motes have been picked up, the boss will move a final time and then retreat into the ground ending the first encounter.  </p>

				<h2 id="small-title">Second Encounter</h2>
				<%= image_tag "garden/garden_relay.jpg" %></br>

					<h2 id="small-title">Overview and Setup</h2>
						<p id="details">The goal for this encounter is to tether to each relay, and clear the four waves of angelic's at each plate after all four have been tethered to. Once the four angelic waves have been cleared, the center will be opened and two more waves of adds will be cleared as a group. For this encoutner I usually divide teams into three teams of two, two players will stay at the bottom, two players will go left, and two players will go right. These teams will split up after the first round of relays, but for the initial clear I find it to be fastest. There will occasionally be other strategies where two people will stay at bottom, and four players will go left moving clockwise around the four positions dropping players off as they move. When tethering to the relay any players in the tether will gain a 40 second buff called "enlightened" that will allow them to break the shields over the adds that spawn. The shields cannot be broken with any other damage, so its essential to break shields first before worrying about killing as to prevent a possible loss of buff while shielded enemies still remain. Each position will have two hob goblin barrier champions so anti-barrier weapons are helpful but not necessary. For supers a high damage output super can be very helpful in clearing the champions or angelic's, or a support super such as well or bubble if survivability is an issue. Izanagi's is very helpful as it can generally 1 shot the champions and angelic's with a critical hit, spike grenade launchers or Wendigo are also good, Xenophage can also be good for clearing angelic's from a distance without the difficulty of having to make a critical hit.</p> 

					<h2 id="small-title">First relay tether</h2>
						<p id="details">
						For my strategy, One of the two players moving left will be the bottom-left floater, one will stay fixed left. For the two players moving right, one will be the top-right float and one will be fixed top. Once the right team has buffed at the first relay, they will then move on to clear the top and one of the bottom players will use the right hand portal to move to the right fixed position and stay right, making sure to buff before leaving bottom to ensure they have buff until the top-right floater can portal back down to rebuff.</p>

					<h2 id="small-title">Fixed Players</h2>
						<p id="details">Once a fixed player has arrived at their designated relay, they will no longer need to move between relays. They can move down hallways if needed to pick up ammo, but generally its advised to stay as close to the relay as possible because enemies can occasionally teleport past the player directly to the relay and sacrifice. If the player is running low on buff and have cleared their adds they can preemptively tether to their box and await their float player to finish the connection. This can potentially remove a second or two of time off the buff process, which can be helpful if the float player is running late due to angelic's or other complications. Its important to note that when your fixed position gets the angelic spawn it will lock down your tether box. Its also important to announce the angelic spawn location, so that your float player knows to come and assist you. Call out your location, not your name as it will help with confusion as to which position your located at.</p>

					<h2 id="small-title">Float Players</h2>
						<p id="details">The float players will be moving between their two designated positions rebuffing the fixed players at those positions. The floats are bottom-left and top-right. Ideally you will begin the buff process for the starting location right as "defenses subside" text prompt appears but a few seconds before is not bad either. Once the first fixed position is buffed, the float will use the portals to move to their other fixed location and buff that player, then listen out for an angelic call out. If both of your players are buffed, its acceptable for a float player to move to a non float position to give assistance to the other floaters positions if they have angelic's that round. If you do move to help, try to only kill one angelic before returning back to your side as to prevent a delay in buffs and possible lockout if angelic's spawn while you rebuff your designated positions.</p>

					<h2 id="small-title">Central Relay</h2>
						<p id="details">Once all four locations have cleared their angelic waves, the shields sealing off the central relay will drop and all players should progress inwards towards the central relay. There will be red bar goblins that spawn in the hallways your running down, they can be killed but its ideal to move to the center before hand and then turn around to deal with them as they can occasionally teleport aggressively to middle and possibly sacrifice. Once at the middle, there will be one angelic shielding the central buff box, once its killed its important for all players to line up in a neat line form the box to the relay. Its very important to keep enough distance from the lead player to the end of the line to prevent the end from tethering to the front creating a circle rather than the central relay. For this reason its important to be on ground level, and in a neat line rather than standing on pillars or at strange angels as this can cause a wipe if players tether and don't receive the buff when the next add wave spawns. On the second wave there will be more red bars and two angelic's that need to be dealt with. Once the angelic's and adds are down, players will buff again for the final wave. The last wave has four angelic's and the two waves of red bars as well as explosive harpies called supplicants. Once the last of the enemies have been killed the round will end and the encounter will be cleared.</p>

				<h2 id="small-title">Third Encounter</h2>

					<h2 id="small-title">Overview and Setup</h2>
						<p id="details">For this encounter teams are divided into two teams of three. One team will be responsible for following the boss and picking up his mote spit wipe mechanic, similar to the first encounter. One team will be responsible for picking up motes that fall from defeated yellow bar minotaurs and depositing them into the relays, gaining the enlightened buff and using it to strip shields and prevent sacrifices. Each sacrifice to the relay results in a loss of five motes, and it can send relays negative. Three total sacrifices can occur before a wipe, but usually after one it will result in a wipe due to the added time having to collect more motes to make up. Once 30 motes have been deposited, the boss will be drawn to the relay beginning damage phase. For supers. at least one well with lunafactions and one bubble is ideal. If its possible to have two wells thats even better. Hunters should be on bottom tree golden gun, using celestial nighthawk if possible. If other classes are available its at the party leaders discretion or general consensus as to what they would like to run, but in general support supers will be more beneficial than add clear. For equipment, Izanagi's Burden or Whisper of the Worm are your ideal damage dealers. One player should also run Divinity if possible, ideally one of the players who does not have catalyst for their damage weapon or a random person if all players have catalyst. If using Izanagi's a grenade launcher can also be used, either one with spike grenades or Wendigo. There are no champions so specialized mods are not needed at this point, in general most adds will be red bars with the exclusion of the mote carrying minotaurs.</p>

					<h2 id="small-title">Eyes Team</h2>
						<p id="details">The role of the eyes team is to follow the boss and pick up the mote spit, preventing the encounter from wiping. Its important to note the boss will travel between the four main tunnels, North, South, East, and West. The North tunnel being the spinning section, to make it easier to locate a direction when making call outs or trying to find the bosses movement location. The boss will begin by sitting in the middle of the arena and firing at players, before tucking his fins in and moving down one of the cardinal directional tunnels. A call out can be helpful for players who may have missed the bosses movement. Depending on the style of the mote pickup, the first mote will be picked up by either the third mote player or the first eye player. If the mote team is picking up in 5-10-10-5 style, the mote teams third pickup will supplement in for the eyes team to give extra time for pickups before a sacrifice must be made. If the pickup is in 10-10-10 order the first eyes player will be picking up first. Similarly to the first encoutner, the mote pickup is proximity based so its important for players to give the player picking up some room as to not also receive the debuff from the mote. Once a player has picked up the mote, the boss will then lock that player into position, and flare its fins up and approach the player. There will be two spots on each of the bosses fins, with one dot closer to the center called "inner" and one further out called "outer". These are important because shooting the wrong one will kill the detained player. The detained player is the only one who can see which is the correct of the two to shoot, so its important that the detained player makes a loud verbal call out when the dots appear. One dot will be red, the other white. The red dot is the correct one to shoot. Non-detained players will only see red dots and will have to guess if the detained player does not make a call out, given its around a 3 second window before they are killed by the boss. On a successful stun, the boss releases the detained player and returns to the middle. The players will follow the boss repeatedly until the boss is drawn to the damage phase. Its important to note the boss will push you in mid air if it collides with you, so be careful jumping back into the center. The North position also is too far for hunters to jump without stompees, so its good to use the first rotating plate as a jumping off point when moving between the center and north tunnel.</p>

					<h2 id="small-title">Motes Team</h2>
						<p id="details">The mote teams responsibility is to kill minotaurs and collect the motes they drop, depositing in either sets of 5-10-10-5 or 10-10-10 depending on the groups preference or if the encounter challenge is active. If picking up in 5-10-10-5 format its important for the first mote player to immediately go to the relay after their first five pickup, as if they delay more than likely they will have sacrifices at the relay resulting in a wipe. If doing the 10-10-10 format, the third mote player will immediately go to the relay to act as a defender, having already gained the buff from the tether used to start the encounter. If the mote team uses the first format, the third mote player will go and pick up the firs boss spit for the eyes team so they can pick up more spits without having to use a revive to prolong the eye phase. The first minotaur will always spawn in the same hallway that the relay is located on, the relay can also be determined by a large pillar of light coming out of it. Once the first pickup is made, the second mote player will collect ten motes and go and deposit them at the relay reliving the first mote player. The third mote player will then collect ten motes and go to relive the second at the relay. The first player will head back to the center, either assisting the third mote player in killing minotaurs or if they already have the next set of ten motes they will collect their final five and return to the relay. The second mote player does not need to return to the center, as they will not need to collect again unless a second damage phase is needed. Once the final five motes are deposited, the boss will be drawn to the relay for damage. Its important to call out the last five are headed for deposit, as the eyes team may ask for a delayed deposit to prevent the boss from glitching out during its spit mechanic if they are in the middle of it.</p>

					<h2 id="small-title">Boss Damage</h2>
						<p id="details">Once the boss has been drawn to the relay, the damage phase will begin. A bubble should be placed behind the relay, with the front end of the bubble overlapping the relay but not covering over it. A well will be played in front of the relay, with a small portion of it being inside the bubble is fine. If there is only one warlock running well, a rift can be used instead of the initial well as it will still give the reload boost from lunafactions and bubbles damage buff overrides wells buff. The boss will approach the relay, flaring its fins out which will be covered in red spots. Once all the red spots are destroyed, the bosses eye will change from red to white meaning its open for damage. At this point, the divinity player should apply divinity until the damage phase ends, ideally it will be a player either placing the initial bubble or well as they will then be able to apply with no interruptions. Players should use supers and grenade launchers while the boss is in close proximity, making sure not to move while standing in the well to prevent friendly fire deaths. Once the boss reaches half way down the hallways to center, players will advance forward just past the mouth of the hallway and stand in the second well to continue damage. Once the boss reaches the center of the arena the eye will close and if its not dead a second damage phase will be needed. Rinse and repeat as necessary.</p>
