					<h2 id="small-title">Jumping Puzzle</h2></br>

					<center><%= image_tag "eater/eater_jumping.png" %></center>

					<p id="details">For the jumping puzzle, its as simple as following the leader. The plates can only support one player at a time, if two touch the same plate at the same time it will turn red and fall into the water killing both players. Its imperative to maintain rank and composure when doing this jumping puzzle as panic will generally result in a death or potential failure of the puzzle back to the previous checkpoint. With the assistance of the graphic provided above, there will be slight deviations in the route which you will be taking between the main 3 checkpoints on the way to the finish. The first set of jumps can be handled normally, making sure the player ahead of you has cleared their plate before following on. Once the plates all turn red and the message 'core temperature rises', its safe to move as quickly as possible to the checkpoint. Only 3 players need to make it to the checkpoint to be able to bring the plates up into a locked position, usually 1-2 minutes after standing at the checkpoint. The second set of plates will split into two teams, one right and one left. Teams will alternate between adding players to their plate string, eventually joining after all 6 players have jumped down and moved forward, with the right team leading on the rejoin at plate 9. The third set of plates will branch off after the 6th player is on the board, at the 4th players position. Instead of following to the right, the 4th player will branch off left and continue on until they have advanced 3 places and then allowing the right players to move forward to the checkpoint. The final set of plates, will have one player skipping over, to jump past the eight plate to the seventh.</p>

					<p id="details">The objective of this encounter is to remove the shield around the boss, Argos. This is done by detonating 18 elemental crystals that will spawn in groups of 3 (for a total of 6 per side) on each of its 3 sides. For this encounter, teams will be divided up into three teams of two, one runner and one defender. Supers aren't needed for any boss damage here, so survivability is the key. If you need to use your super to help clear adds, or survive its perfectly fine. Each side will have a central plate, with three burning fires in a triangle configuration. There will be a floating 'vex cranium' in between each of the main plates. The plates are divided by element, arc, solar, and void. Each element will have two players, with the runner responsible for charging the skulls in the fire and running them to the appropriate crystals to detonate them. The crystals can only be detonated by the matching elemental cranium, so each plate will keep two craniums cooking at a time. If 3 of the same elemental color appear on a single set of 3, two craniums will share the center crystal careful to break the first top or bottom crystal and then use their remaining cranium energy on the center crystal. Once a skull has been used to destroy a crystal, if its no longer needed it should be emptied so that another fresh cranium can be spawned. Once all 3 sides have been successfully de-shielded the first phase is over.</p>

					<h2 id="small-title">Argos Phase 2</h2>

					<%= image_tag "eater/argos_orbs.jpg" %></br></br>

					<p id="details">The final phase of the Argos encounter is very similar to phase 1 in that we will be using skulls to remove a protective shielding from over the boss. Similarly to removing the outer shield, this inner shield will be removed with the use of the vex craniums. As seen in the picture above, on one of the three sides of the boss three colored points will appear on the top, left, and right of the bosses shield. These points are colored to represent the skulls that must be charged in order to bring down that shield. Once the corresponding skulls have been charged, they will then be transported by the runners and potentially the defenders of the sides they were being charged at. All other skulls should also be brought over for extra damage once the bosses shield has been dropped. When all three craniums are in place, they will simultaneously shoot their corresponding point, pushing it to the center of the shield with continuous fire. Once this is complete, the shield is then lowered and the boss is available for damage. During the damage phase, the boss will use two different methods to disrupt the damage phase. The first method is to net any guardians standing in front of it, it will shoot a triangular shaped net at a random guardian, catching anyone in its path. The net is slow enough to dodge out of the way of, but if one becomes trapped its important to call out your name and that you've been trapped other wise the net will lift you back off of the play area to your death. The net can be broken by friendly fire. The other defense mechanism the boss will employ are explosive seekers, which will slowly move out of the boss and then rapidly target guardians. These can be shot from the air, or simply avoided by moving quickly out of the way or stepping into a well/bubble. If the boss is not destroyed in one damage phase, there will be a brief period while it regains its shield, allowing guardians to pick back up expended craniums at their spawn locations and charge for the next damage phase. This should be done as quickly as possible, its a limited amount of time before the boss begins his wipe mechanic. Once the wipe mechanic begins, the boss's shield will lower and platforms will spawn along side in two tiers. On the boss there are 6 critical week points, two on each of the arms, two on his back plate, and two on the top of his head. Only two critical points must be broken to stun the boss, allowing another damage phase. Typically, it will go from arm, to head, to back. The reason for this is if the back is broken before hand, he will tilt his head backwards making the head critical spots much harder to see. The arms can be reached from the lower portions of the surrounding platforms and the head and back being accessed from the higher platform. Once the stun mechanic has been performed, the same processes for removing the shield is repeated, up to two more times before a final wipe mechanic is enabled after the boss has no more critical points to stun. Ideally this boss will be killed in two phases or less, preventing the need from having to perform the third stun.</p>
